                            habits, and even lets you connect and compete with others.</p>

                    <h4>Creates space from your phone</h4>
                    <p>Unlike other solutions designed to reduce screen time, the Aro platform combines an app and a
                        physical device to create distance between you and your phone so you can have quality time
                        without the distraction of your phone.</p>

                    <p>We live in a gamified world - badges, streaks, achievements, and filling in that daily ring. Aro
                        gives you credit for the time you spend engaged in real life because the reward builds the habit
                        of putting down your phone.</p>

                    <p>We’ve spent years researching, designing, and developing a solution to help both parents and
                        kids. From a beautiful device Mom won’t hate on the kitchen counter to the celebratory GIFs in

                    <h4>Aspirational, yet practical</h4>
                    <p>No heavy handed approaches here. Getting rid of your phone or completely locking it away are not
                        practical solutions. We need our phones...but maybe not at the dinner table or during a
                        conversation. We designed Aro to fit in your everyday rhythms.</p>
